\section{Conclusions}

This project presents the complete modeling and control workflow for a Synchronous Reluctance Motor (SyR) drive system. Starting from the analysis of motor characteristics, including flux maps and MTPA trajectory, we proceeded to design the current control loops and validate inverter sizing under realistic driving conditions.

Although some simulation results are still under development, the key control structure, including FOC design and flux weakening strategy, has been successfully implemented and tested. The results confirm that the system can track desired torque and current references with acceptable performance.

Future work will focus on finalizing all test cases and extending the model to include thermal effects and more detailed loss modeling for improved accuracy.
