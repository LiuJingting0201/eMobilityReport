\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to design and simulate a complete electric powertrain system for an electric vehicle (xEV), consisting of a DC-DC converter, a three-phase inverter, and a synchronous electric motor. The system is developed based on the data provided in the file \texttt{Data06.mat}, which includes technical specifications of both the DC-DC converter and the electric machine.

The main objectives of the project are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To size the passive components of the DC-DC converter and evaluate the voltage and current stresses.
  \item To design and tune cascaded PI controllers for voltage and current regulation in the DC-DC stage.
  \item To analyze the magnetic model of the provided motor and identify its key parameters.
  \item To determine the required inverter ratings based on the driving cycle and flux weakening (FW) analysis.
  \item To implement a field-oriented control (FOC) algorithm for the motor drive system.
  \item To simulate and validate the full system behavior in MATLAB/Simulink, including both steady-state and transient responses.
\end{itemize}

The final deliverables include a detailed technical report, complete simulation models, and performance analysis. The methodology adopted follows the guidelines provided in the course documentation and lectures.
