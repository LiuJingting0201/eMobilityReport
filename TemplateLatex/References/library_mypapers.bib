  Abstract                 = {Digital multimeters (DMMs) Agilent 3458A are valuable devices in accurate characterization of voltage transducers. Five selectable ranges, from 100 mV to 1 kV, high input impedance and accuracy make this device the state of the art. The paper focuses on the correction of the multimeter frequency response when used in Direct Current digitising mode (DCV), to allow post-correction of the errors introduced by the digitizers. To this end, two different approaches for the identification of the multimeter input complex filter function up to about 100 kHz are proposed. They are, respectively, based on the identification of the complex filter transfer function considering the input stage of the DMM as a black box and on the estimation of the parameter of the DMM input stage. The two methods are validated in a test case and equivalence of the results obtained is found. As a further verification, a deep investigation of DCV and direct sampling mode is performed when the zero level trigger mode is set.},

  Abstract                 = {Synchronous reluctance machines are a valid alternative to induction motors for industrial applications requiring variable speed regulation. To mitigate the well-known downside of their lower power factor, permanent-magnet-assisted topologies are adopted. Both high-strength rare-earth magnets and low cost ferrite magnets can be used in such machines. Their design and optimization procedures have been discussed in related literature. This paper compares synchronous reluctance machines assisted with NdFeB and ferrite magnets, focusing on torque overload capability and feasibility of saliency-based position estimation algorithms. Three prototypes were realized and tested. They all have the stator of a commercial induction motor, and three custom synchronous reluctance rotors with same laminations: one has no magnets, the other two have NdFeB and ferrite magnets respectively, designed to give the same torque at rated current. Results from simulations and experiments are presented, focusing on torque and demagnetization limits in the over-current loading range. Moreover, the feasibility of saliency-based sensorless methods is investigated, both at high and low current loads. The results of the paper suggest that the ferrite-assisted solution is the candidate solution for replacing induction motors in variable speed applications.},

Previous work demonstrated the feasibility of sensorless identification of the flux maps, performed by exciting the machine with square-wave voltage pulses at standstill, and without the need of rotor locking. The rotor position was initially estimated and then used throughout the identification, in open-loop fashion. In some cases, rotor oscillation and eventually position drift led to stop the identification before the programmed dq current domain was covered entirely. In this paper, the rotor position is closed-loop tracked during the motor commissioning to counteract the occurrence of rotor movement. The hysteresis-controlled excitation voltage is augmented with an high-frequency (HF) square-wave voltage component, and the position is tracked through demodulation of the current response to such HF component. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on a 2.2-kW SyRM prototype. The results show that the id, iqcommissioning domain is substantially extended, resulting in more accurate flux maps. Moreover, self-tuning of the method is addressed and possible causes of error are analyzed and commented.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the self-commissioning of synchronous reluctance motors. Previous work has demonstrated that the motor flux maps can be accurately identified at standstill by exciting the machine with square-wave voltage pulses of large amplitude, of the same order of the machine nominal voltage. This was made without the need of rotor locking and without using position sensors. The knowledge of the d and q axes position was obtained by a preliminary sensorless commissioning and then used for directing the d and q voltage pulses accordingly, in open-loop fashion. At free shaft, the position tends to oscillate under such alternated excitation, introducing position error and thus inaccuracy. For high values of the torque current component iqthe rotor can even start spinning suddenly, thus stopping the identification. The loss of control impedes of identification of the flux maps above a certain limit, at least in the q direction. In the past, polynomial fitting was used to extrapolate the flux map in the missing parts of the dq current domain, with good results. In this paper, the rotor position is closed-loop estimated during the motor commissioning, so to counteract the occurrence of sudden spin and extend the explored current area in the q direction. An additional pulsating voltage, also of the square-wave type, is superimposed to the main excitation voltage, and the position is tracked through current demodulation. In this way, the area explored in the dq current plane is substantially extended, if compared to previous method. The proposed approach is verified through experimental results on one synchronous reluctance motor prototype.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a sensorless self-commissioning technique for PM-assisted synchronous reluctance motors. The identification of the machine's flux maps is performed at standstill without any position transducer and with no need of rotor locking. The machine is first excited with alternated high voltage pulses, injected in the estimated d and q directions of the rotor to determine its saturation curves. Then, direct current values are applied in a fixed stator direction so that the rotor aligns in specific positions giving information on the PM flux linkage. Experimental results are provided on a PM-assisted synchronous reluctance motor prototype, confirming the validity of the proposed method. The key original feature of the proposed work is the estimation of magnet flux linkage at standstill. For the motor under test, the magnet flux linkage was sensorless estimated at standstill with an error lower than 3%.},

  Abstract                 = {An alternative to the high frequency injection approach for sensorless control at zero and low speed region is proposed for synchronous reluctance machines (SyR) using finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). The saliency based position estimate aims to exploit the switching current ripple which is pronounced owing to the nature of MPC especially around zero and low speed region due to the minimal back-emf. A demerit of the high frequency injection techniques is the bandwidth hindrance of position observer by the demodulating low pass filter (LPF). In the proposed method, no such filters are required and consequently, high bandwidth is achieved. Guidelines for the calibration of observers are addressed. In addition, the effects of cross-saturation on position estimation is inherently considered. The experimental validation on a 1 kW SyR shows stable operation under torque and speed transients, and proves the feasibility of the proposed technique.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a sensorless direct flux vector control scheme for synchronous reluctance motor drives. Torque is controlled at constant switching frequency, via the closed loop regulation of the stator flux linkage vector and of the current component in quadrature with it, using the stator flux oriented reference frame. A hybrid flux and position observer combines back-electromotive force (EMF) integration with pulsating voltage injection around zero speed. Around zero speed, the position observer takes advantage of injected pulsating voltage. Instead of the commonly used current demodulation, the position error feedback is extracted here at the output of the observer's flux maps, thus resulting in immunity toward the cross-saturation position error. The maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) strategy is used. A detailed analysis puts in evidence the key advantages and disadvantages related to the use of the MTPA in the sensorless control of the synchronous reluctance machine, for both the saliency-based and the back-EMF based sensorless methods. Extensive experimental results are reported for a 2.2 kW synchronous reluctance motor prototype, showing the feasibility of the proposed method. These include speed response to step and sinusoidal load disturbances at standstill, up to 121% of rated torque, and speed response tests covering the flux weakening speed region.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a sensorless control scheme for synchronous reluctance (SyR) motor drives based on the direct-flux vector control (DFVC) method. The control operates in stator-flux-oriented coordinates, using constant switching frequency. A hybrid position and speed observer is proposed, based on the combination of the active flux concept and high-frequency signal injection and demodulation. The two methods are fused together to form a unique position and speed estimate signals, with seamless transition between the two models based on reference speed. The proposed observer covers a wide speed range, from standstill operation at full load to flux weakening (FW). Furthermore, it is inherently immune from position estimation error caused by cross saturation, as proven mathematically and experimentally. The motor is operated according to the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) law. Specific issues related to MTPA around zero torque are addressed in this paper. The proposed control technique extends the range of application of the DFVC to encoderless drives, and can be usefully adopted in those applications where both zero-speed and FW speed range operations are necessary, such as home appliances, or automotive and aerospace actuators and generators. A 2.2-kW SyR motor prototype was tested to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Key tuning aspects are addressed in this paper.},
